Current ideas:

- See who's on campus [FINSHED]
- Serverless app [BREAKS TOS]
- Threading [FINISHED]
- Actual website to have everything in one place when I add more [NEXT UP]
- Use own database and keep it updated (following GDPR) [NEXT UP]
- Leaderboard

To do:

- Bypass rate limit
- Inform user of potential issues with APIs responses (such as missing pages)
- Docker secrets for extra security in sharing the private authorization token (currently using Js' dotenv)
